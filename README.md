# dra-analytics
The dra-analytics library consolidates all the metrics used in DRA in one place.

These libraries are all packaged in this repository. Normally they are included like this:

    import { Partisan, Minority, Compactness, Splitting } from '@dra2020/dra-client';

Then the various functions of the different sets are available under their appropriate symbol.

These are the libraries:

- [Minority](./docs/minority.md): [TODO: Describe minority library].

The analytics in DRA include metrics favored by and build on the work of [many scholars](./docs/attributions.md).
