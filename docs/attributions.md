The analytics in DRA 2020 include metrics favored by and build on the work of many scholars (in alphabetical order):

- Stephen Ansolabehere (Harvard) -- I worked with him to add racially polarized voting analysis.
- Moon Duchin (Tufts) -- Our county-district splitting metrics build on her proposal.
- Jon Eguia (Michigan State) -- I worked with him to add his measure of geographic bias.
- Gary King (Harvard) -- I worked closely with co-author Aaron Kaufman (now of NYU) to get their "know it when you see it" (KIWYSI) compactness scoring into DRA.
- Michael D. McDonald (SUNY) -- Meanâ€“median difference
- John Nagle (CMU) -- His fractional seat probabilities technique is the foundation of our methodology. I also collaborated extremely closely with him on our advanced partisan analytics.
- Nick Stephanopoulos (Harvard) & Eric McGhee (PPIC) -- Efficiency gap
- Gregory Warrington (UVM) -- Declination
- Sam Wang (Princeton) -- We had many conversations with Sam & his team over the last few years. His suggestions strongly influenced our dashboard, and he made several introductions that were extremely helpful. The effective splits and uncertainty of membership community splitting metrics are his.

We are indebted to all these people and more. All policy & presentation choices were ultimately mine, any remain errors in implementation are mine.
